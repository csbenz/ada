# Abstract
#### A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

The aim of this project is to explore the 200 years of history given by *Le Temps* to extract how the Lausanne and Geneva's region saw the evolution of major human's right evolution in the world and in Switzerland.
We will first compute a list of all major human's right from this period of history using external dataset or by analyse the text of articles. Compute relation with *Le Temps* dataset to see what gave interest last centuaries.
On se second part, we will then check how Switzerland evolve on these relation by looking on each big relation how the Swiss people were informed on these evolution and how Switzerland react to these evolution.
We can finnaly compare the time people get informed on these evolution with the real time they really get in place.
